```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Goal

Play with the options to show images in a RMarkdown document

## Reference

This analysis is based on the blog post by ZevRoss [link](http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/)

## Set-up

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)
library(magick)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

I will use the PNG image I created to view all named R colors, 657 in total, in  [GitHub](https://github.com/pep1024/20220107_colors_in_r/blob/main/all_R_named_colors_plot.png) and a plot generated with R package {ggplot2}

### Image

```{r}
im1 <- magick::image_read("all_R_named_colors_plot.png")
image_info(im1)
```

``` r
knitr::include_graphics("all_R_named_colors_plot.png")
```

Note that, in the viewer pane, the image has better resolution than in the Rmarkdown doc.
The reason is that once the doc in knitted, dpi is set to the default of knit (72) instead
of the 96 dpi it had originally. 

If we change dpi to 96 with `dpi = 96` within function `include_graphics`, the results (pane and knitted doc) are the same


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("all_R_named_colors_plot.png", dpi = 96)
```

In the case of the plot, both images (Rmarkdown -pane- and knit) look like the same.

```{r}
(plot1 <- ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point())
```

Using `fig.width = 5` in the R chunk properties only changes figures and 
not images size

<!--
```{r, fig.width=5}
knitr::include_graphics("all_R_named_colors_plot.png", dpi = 96)
```
-->

```{r, fig.width=5}
plot1
```

To change image size, we can use `out.width` given in % or px (pixels). 
The image is obtained with `out.width = "30%"` and the figure with 
`out.width="200px"`

```{r, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("all_R_named_colors_plot.png", dpi = 96)
```

```{r, out.width="200px"}
plot1
```

Also, for images, we can use Markdown 

``` r
![](all_R_named_colors_plot.png){width=50%}
```

![](all_R_named_colors_plot.png){width=50%}
